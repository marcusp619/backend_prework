Updated Prework!

# Backend Prework Repository

This repository will walk you through the prework for the Backend program at Turing.

## Setup

The first thing you need to do is *fork and clone down this repository* using the steps below:

1. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub (if you are not logged in, log in and come back to this page)
1. Click on `Fork` in the upper right corner of the screen _this will take you to a new page_  
   _Now, you should be on your copy of this repository!_
1. Click on `Clone or Download`  
   _If you see `Clone with HTTPS` click on `Use SSH`_
1. Click on the copy icon to copy the SSH link to your clipboard.
1. Open your terminal
1. Navigate to where you would like to save your prework  
   _I suggest creating a directory named 'turing' and within that directory, a directory named 'prework'_
1. Enter the following into your terminal `git clone <paste the copied ssh link>`  
   _You now have a copy of this repository on your local machine!_  
1. In your terminal, `cd backend_prework`
1. And, `atom .`
1. This will open the repository in the Atom text editor

Now that this setup is finished, you can follow along with steps for each day below to complete your prework!

## Day 1

1. Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository - if you followed the suggested directory structure from the setup, you should be able to run the following command from your home directory `cd turing/prework`. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository.

1. Work through the following lessons from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.  As you work through these lessons, you will be creating some ruby files; put these files in your day_1 directory.  In the day_1 directory you will see a file called lrthw_notes.md - this is where you can put the answers to any questions or reflections from the lessons. The .md file extension for this file refers to markdown formatting. Markdown is a simple markup language to help format your text. [This article](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) shows everything you need for basic markdown formatting.
